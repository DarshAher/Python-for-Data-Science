Unlike some languages, Python does not require you to declare the type of a variable upfront – the type is inferred from the value you assign to it. You can even reassign a variable to a value of a different type later (though it's good practice to keep the type consistent for a given variable).\n",

Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number. They are case-sensitive (e.g., `Data` and `data` would be different variables)."

These fundamentals are the building blocks of writing any Python program. By practicing the concepts and exercises provided, you should now be able to write simple scripts and functions on your own. This is just the beginning of your Python journey. With a solid grasp of the basics, you're ready to explore more advanced topics like working with libraries for data science (NumPy, pandas, etc.), data visualization, and more.
